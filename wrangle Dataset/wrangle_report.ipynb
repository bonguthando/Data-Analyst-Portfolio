    "I start by gathering 3 different datasets. Twitter_archive dataset was downloaded from Udacity classroom and read using pandas libraries, Image_predictions dataset is a link from the Udacity classroom and the Tweets_json dataset… In Jupyter Notebooks I imported the relevant packages I will require to display and analyse the data. These are: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, json, os and requests. I used pandas to read and assess the kind of data I am dealing with, using .info() on the Twitter_archive database to get an overview of the data. This was done on the Image_prediction and Tweet_json datasets. Then I used other tools such as .describe(), .duplicated(), .value_counts() and others to see if the data need to be cleaned.\n",
